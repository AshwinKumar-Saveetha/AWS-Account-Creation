# CREATE AN  ACCOUNT IN AWS SET UP A ROOT USER AND AN IAM USER 
## AIM

To create a cloud account in Microsoft Azure and to explore its services such as Compute, Networking , and Storage.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

This experiment is about creating an AWS account and setting up secure access. First, an AWS account is created using an email, which gives root user access. The root user has full control over all services, so it is secured with a strong password and multi-factor authentication. Then, an IAM user is created with limited permissions to perform daily tasks, ensuring the root user is only used for critical account-level activities. This approach improves security and manages access efficiently.

## ALGORITHM
## Step 1:
Go to the Azure Website
•	Visit https://azure.microsoft.com
•	Click on “Start free” or “Free account” in the top right corner.
## Step 2: 
Sign Up with Microsoft Account
•	If you already have a Microsoft account (Outlook/Hotmail), sign in.
•	Otherwise, create a new Microsoft account using your email.
## Step 3:
Enter Account Information
•	Provide your basic details such as name, country/region, phone number, and verification details.
## Step 4:
Identity Verification
•	Enter your mobile number and verify using OTP (SMS or call).
## Step 5: 
Select Support Plan
•	Choose the Basic Support Plan (Free) for beginners.
## Step 6: 
Complete Sign-Up
•	Review details and click Sign Up.
•	You’ll receive a confirmation email and your Azure account will be activated.
## Step 7:
Sign In to Azure Portal
•	Go to https://portal.azure.com
•	Sign in with your Microsoft account.
•	This is the main dashboard where you can explore all Azure services.


## COMMANDS
Create a User with Administrative Access (Azure Active Directory):
Secure your Azure account root user
•	Sign in to the Azure Portal as the account owner.
•	Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for your account.
Create a new administrative user
•	Go to Azure Active Directory (AAD) → Users → New User.
•	Assign a username and set a temporary password.
•	Under Roles, assign Global Administrator or Owner role.
Sign in as the administrative user
•	Use the newly created credentials to sign in.
•	Change the password on first login.
•	Now use this admin account for everyday tasks (instead of root).
## Services Overview in Azure:
Azure provides 200+ cloud services. In this experiment, we focus on the following key categories:
## Compute Service in Azure
Definition: Compute services provide the processing power to run applications, host websites, or execute workloads in the cloud.

Examples: Virtual Machines, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), App Services.

Supports auto-scaling and load balancing.

Enables on-demand resources with pay-as-you-go pricing.

## Storage Service in Azure
Definition: Storage services allow you to store, manage, and access data securely in the cloud.

Types: Blob Storage, File Storage, Queue Storage, Table Storage.

Highly durable and redundant.

Supports large-scale data handling and backup solutions.

## Networking Service in Azure
Definition: Networking services connect cloud resources, provide secure communication, and manage data flow.

Examples: Virtual Network (VNet), Load Balancer, VPN Gateway, Azure CDN.

Ensures secure and fast connectivity between resources.

Supports hybrid and multi-region connections.
